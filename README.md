# Encapture Frontend (Final Capstone)

> Project built with React & Redux. This project is frontend of an appointment booking app for salon services. I have used "Talwind" for style. This app built for tablet to desktop screen ( >= 768) size. User can take following actions:

    - User can sign up for the salon app
    - User can sign in with the existing account
    - A signed user will have a name and a logout button on the top
    - User can see and reserve services for booking
    - Services can be added to the cart without sign in but at the time of booking you will be redirected to sign-in page
    - On the header, the User can see the count of items and the total amount of items in the cart
    - With the click of a service card, a modal will open for service details 
    - A signed-in user can see her appointments on the My Appointment page
    - A service can be added once for a per appointment
    - If a service is already in the cart the Reserve button will be disabled with the text "Added"
    - On the click of the shopping bag icon on the header will take you to the cart page
    - Using Jest and React testing library for testing

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.

You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.
